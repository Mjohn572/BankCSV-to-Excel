# BankCSV-to-Excel

This is my second attempt at completing this project. The main reason for creating a new repository is in my old one I included my bank statement in it. 
So a new one would allow me to have it publically available. Additionally, I have just found out about downloading bank transactions in a csv file, which is bascially
half of my work of my previous project so I need to revise it. 

Although I feel a bit silly for doing that work for nothing, it has helped me remember how to code in python and I found myself enjoying the process. 

Now on to my requirements for this new project now that I know I can just get a CSV file easily from my bank.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Must ask the user for a csv file to upload/use: this is to ensure I do not upload anything personal into Github (oops) and if someone else wants to use it they can.
2. Will have a database (csv file) of common transaction places and will relate them to specific categories; This will streamline my process of looking over my bank transactions.
3. When the system confronts an unknown transaction, it will ask which category it would like to go into. This will increase in efficiency every time I upload a new file.
4. Will spit out a csv file to then be used seamlessly in excel.
